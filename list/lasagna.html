    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch <br>
       tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna <br>
       filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd  <br>
       cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy <br>
       green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>

           <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            
           <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>

            <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>

           <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
           
           <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>

           <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano,
             <br> salt, and black pepper.</li>

           <li><strong>Noodles: </strong>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, 
            <br>but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>

           <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded 
                <br> mozzarella.</li>
           <li>
           <strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means 
               <br> they hold the layer together).
           </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
